# Getting Started With Cloud Native Go
This is for tracking my progress in the LinkedIn Learning online course
[Getting Started With Cloud Native Go](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-with-cloud-native-go/).

## Purpose
I am hoping this will give me more practice with Go and Kubernetes.
I have had an interest in becoming more familiar with Go and Kubernetes for a while, and am hoping this course will tie the two together nicely.

In addition, I haven't felt like I've spent enough time outside of work practicing with different technologies.
I am hoping this will get me to practice more while I think of my next pet project to work on.

## Chapter 1
This chapter was a general overview of the course. The plan is as follows:
1) Conceptual introductions for the course
1) Create simple Go microservices
1) Containerize using Docker
1) Orchestrate using Kubernetes

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 started with getting a basic HTTP server.
We then created a couple endpoints:
1) api/echo: Simply print back the value of "message" in the URI
1) api/books: Print a collection of book objects

## Chapter 3
Chapter 3 introduces how to get your app running on a Docker container

## DONE
I have chosen to not complete this course and look into something different.

# Getting Started With Cloud Native Go
This is for tracking my progress in the LinkedIn Learning online course
[Getting Started With Cloud Native Go](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-with-cloud-native-go/).

## Purpose
I am hoping this will give me more practice with Go and Kubernetes.
I have had an interest in becoming more familiar with Go and Kubernetes for a while, and am hoping this course will tie the two together nicely.

In addition, I haven't felt like I've spent enough time outside of work practicing with different technologies.
I am hoping this will get me to practice more while I think of my next pet project to work on.
